# CodingTheory

These are my own projects on coding theory. The project CodeGeneration contains a main.cpp file, a few source code files and a few headers.

1. FanoCode.cpp contains the code for generating the Fano codes for a given set of probabilities. 

2. ShannonCode.cpp contains the code for generating the shannon codes for a given set of probabilities.

3. utilities.cpp contain frequently used coding functions.

4. funcDeclare.h contains the function declarations and Libraries.h contains all the standard libraries that are to be included.

***********What other files need can be stated here ***************
# Some Conventions we follow 

1. variable and function identifiers begin with small letters(eg : ***codes***, not Codes/CODES)

2. For readability of the identifiers (eg : Fano Code), variables should use underscores instead of capitals.(eg : ***fano_code***, not fanoCode)

3. Function idfentifiers should use Capitals in the middle for readability(eg : ***fanoCode()***, not fano_code())

4. Enumeration identifiers should begin with Capital letters and use Capitals for readability (eg : ***CodeMethod***, not codeMethod/Codemethod/code_method)

5. Enumerators should begin with 'e' and follow up with all capital letters (eg : ***eFANO***, not FANO/efano/eFano)

6. Structs can follow same convention as Enumeration identifiers. Its member variables follow same conventions as normal variables. 

7. Global variables' identifiers should be capital letters following a small 'g'(stands for global) (eg : ***gSTAR_COUNT***)
