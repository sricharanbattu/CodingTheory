# CodingTheory

These are my own projects on coding theory. The project CodeGeneration contains a main.cpp file, a few source code files and a few headers.

1. FanoCode.cpp contains the code for generating the Fano codes for a given set of probabilities. 

2. ShannonCode.cpp contains the code for generating the shannon codes for a given set of probabilities.

3. utilities.cpp contain frequently used coding functions.

4. funcDeclare.h contains the function declarations and Libraries.h contains all the standard libraries that are to be included.
